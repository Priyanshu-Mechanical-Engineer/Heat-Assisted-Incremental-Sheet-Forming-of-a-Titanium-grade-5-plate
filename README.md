## 📖 Project Overview  
This repository presents our **Capstone Project** on *Heat-Assisted Incremental Sheet Forming (HA-ISF)* of **Ti-6Al-4V (Grade 5 Titanium alloy)**.  
The project demonstrates how **thermal assistance** enhances the formability of titanium alloys, enabling the production of complex aerospace and biomedical components with improved accuracy and reduced risk of fracture.  

Key focus areas:  
- Simulation-driven exploration of **thermomechanical behavior**.  
- Comparative analysis between **room temperature (25 °C)** and **elevated temperature (600 °C)** forming.  
- Development of a **robust computational workflow** integrating CAD, CAM, and FEM tools.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Investigate **temperature-dependent stress–strain behavior** of Ti-6Al-4V.  
- Simulate **incremental sheet forming (ISF)** at varying depths (9.5–69.5 mm) and wall angles (20°–60°).  
- Quantify **stress reduction, thickness retention, and forming forces** with heat assistance.  
- Propose **future design strategies** for experimental HA-ISF prototypes.
